\title{Identify defoliation events as growth surges in a host series}
\usage{
id_defoliation(input_series, duration_years = 8, max_surge = 1.28,
  bridge_events = FALSE, series_end_event = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_series}{a data frame with 5 columns, as generated by \code{gsi}.}

\item{duration_years}{the minimum length of time in which the tree is
considered to be in defoliation}

\item{max_surge}{minimum value of ngsi required to be considered an
event. If a sequence of possitive ngsi values does not reach this threshold,
the potential event is rejected. Defaults to 1.28 (sd units).}

\item{bridge_events}{Binary, defaults to \code{FALSE}. This option allows for
successive events that are separated by a single year to be bridged and become one
event. It should be used cautiously and closely evaluated to ensure the
likelihood that the two (or more) events are actually one long event.}

\item{series_end_event}{Binary, defaults to \code{FALSE}. This option allows
the user to identify an event ocuring at the time of sampling as a
defoliation event, regardless of duration. Including it will help to
quantify periodicity and extent of an outbreak. This should only be used if
the user has direct knowledge of an ongoing defoliation event when the
trees were sampled.}
}
\value{
after performing runs analyses, the function adds a column to the
  input data frame that distinguishes years of defoliation and the maximum
  defoliation year (ie. the year the greatest negative growth departure
  within the event).
