\title{Identify defoliation events in host trees}
\usage{
defoliate_trees(host_tree, nonhost_chron, duration_years = 8,
  max_surge = 1.28, bridge_events = FALSE, series_end_event = FALSE,
  list_output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{host_tree}{a data.frame rwl object containing the tree-level growth
series for all host trees to be compared to the non-host chronology}

\item{nonhost_chron}{a data.frame rwl object comtaining a single non-host
chronology}

\item{duration_years}{the mimimum number of years in which to consider a
defolation event}

\item{max_surge}{the minimum level of tree growth to be considered in
defoliation}

\item{bridge_events}{Binary, defaults to \code{FALSE}. This option allows for
two successive events separated by a single year to be bridged and called one
event. It should be used cautiously and closely evaluated to ensure the
likelihood that the two events are actually one long event.}

\item{series_end_event}{Binary, defaults to \code{FALSE}. This option allows
the user to identify an event ocuring at the time of sampling as a
defoliation event, regardless of duration. Including it will help to
quantify periodicity and extent of an outbreak. This should only be used if
the user has direct knowledge of an ongoing defoliation event when the
trees were sampled.}

\item{list_output}{defaults to \code{FALSE}. This option is to output a long
list object containing a separate data.frame for each series in
\code{host_tree} that includes the input series and the
\code{nonhost_chron}, the corrected series, and the character string
identifying the defoliation events.}
}
\value{
By default this returns a long-form data frame of tree-level growth
  suppression indices and identified defoliation events. If \code{list_output
  = TRUE}, it returns a list object with each element containing a data.frame
  rwl object of the host and non-host series, plus the outputs from
  \code{gsi}. The list object is useful for assessing the effects of running
  \code{gsi} on the host and nonhost data.

\description{
Identify defoliation events in host trees
}
\note{
Other functions in \code{dfoliatR}, like \code{outbreak} and
  \code{plot_defol}, require a long-form data frame identifiable as a
  \code{defol} object. Selecting \code{list_output = TRUE} will trigger
  errors in running other functions.
